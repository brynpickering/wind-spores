# Average wind speed

@fig:compare_wind_speeds shows the 100m average wind speed given by two different wind speed datasets.
COSMO-REA2 has a horizontal resolution of 2km while the New European Wind Atlas (NEWA) has a horizontal resolution of 3km.
In [@Pickering:2020] we showed that the high resolution of COSMO-REA2 was necessary to resolve key meteorological phenomena exhibited in the complex terrain of Switzerland.

Capacity factors are calculated using a) Enercon E82 2000 at 78m and b) Enercon E82 2000 at 99m, which correspond to the turbines found at those sites.](../build/results/compare_specific_sites_cosmo_newa.pdf){ #fig:compare_specific_sites_cosmo_newa .class}
